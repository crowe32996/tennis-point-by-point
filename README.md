# Tennis Pressure Simulation Project üéæ

This project analyzes tennis match data at the **point-by-point** level at Grand Slam matches from 2020-2024, using Monte Carlo simulations to estimate the *importance* of each point in a match. The goal is to identify which players perform best or worst under pressure by simulating match outcomes based on serve/return win probabilities and match state.

The data sources are csv files produced by Jeff Sackmann (https://github.com/JeffSackmann/tennis_slam_pointbypoint), and are manipulated to get current match state, and determine the level of importance of the point. 1000 full-match simulations are run per point based on the current match score, and for if each player wins that given point. The difference between those probabilities is what I am defining as the point importance, or the probability swing associated with that point. The simulation probabilities can vary from run to run, but are normalized as the number of simulations increase.

The streamlit app visualizes the findings of these simulations, and highlights players who fare better or worse than their overall average when facing points of higher importance. The user can set the threshold of point importance, as well as chosing to look at performance of players when on server, on returner, or both.

## Overview

The project consists of four main components:

1. **`prepare_data.py`**  
   Prepares and cleans the raw tennis match datasets, reconstructs game scores and match states, and outputs a merged CSV ready for simulation.

2. **`point_importance_simulation.py`**  
   Contains the core Monte Carlo simulation logic to simulate tennis points, games, tiebreaks, sets, and matches. Calculates the importance of each point by estimating how winning or losing it affects the player‚Äôs overall chance of winning the match.

3. **`main_full_run.py`**  
   Runs the importance simulation over the entire dataset in chunks (to handle large files efficiently), and saves the enriched results with importance scores into a DuckDB database and an output CSV.

4. **`streamlit_app.py`**  
   A Streamlit web app to interactively explore the simulation results. It lets users filter by tournament, gender, perspective (serve/return), and see which players thrive or struggle under pressure with intuitive tables and visualizations.

## File Details

### 1. `prepare_data.py`

- Parses raw tennis data files.
- Reconstructs match scoring sequences (points, games, sets).
- Adds calculated columns needed for simulations.
- Outputs a merged, cleaned CSV (`merged_tennis_data.csv`) to be used by simulations.

### 2. `point_importance_simulation.py`

- Uses `numba` for fast Monte Carlo simulation of tennis matches at the point level.
- Simulates games, tiebreaks, sets, and full matches based on player serve/return win probabilities.
- Calculates **point importance**: difference in probability of winning the match if player wins vs loses that point.
- Provides functions to apply simulations row-wise on match point dataframes.

### 3. `main_full_run.py`

- Loads the prepared CSV in chunks to avoid memory overload.
- Filters and cleans data (e.g., ensures valid point numbers).
- Runs importance simulations on each chunk with configurable simulation counts.
- Stores results incrementally in a DuckDB database for fast querying.
- Exports a full CSV file (`all_points_with_importance.csv`) with the importance scores added.

### 4. `streamlit_app.py`

- Loads results from DuckDB or CSV.
- Provides user controls for filtering by tournament, gender, and perspective (serve/return/all).
- Calculates clutch statistics per player ‚Äî how their performance changes under pressure.
- Displays top/worst performers and heatmaps of win rates by game score.
- Interactive UI powered by Streamlit and Altair.

## How to Run

### Requirements

- Python 3.8+
- Packages: `pandas`, `numpy`, `numba`, `duckdb`, `streamlit`, `altair`, `re` (standard)

Install dependencies via pip:

```bash
pip install pandas numpy numba duckdb streamlit altair
```

Step 1: Prepare Data
Run the data preparation script to create the merged dataset:

```bash
python prepare_data.py
```

Step 2: Run Point Importance Simulations
Run the full simulation to compute point importance scores and save results:

```bash
python main_full_run.py
```

This may take some time depending on your machine and simulation count.

Step 3: Launch Interactive Explorer
Start the Streamlit app to explore results:

```bash
streamlit run streamlit_app.py
```

Open the URL shown in your terminal (http://localhost:8501)


Notes

- Simulations are stochastic and results vary slightly per run.

- N_SIMULATIONS parameter in main_full_run.py controls simulation accuracy vs speed.

- DuckDB enables efficient querying on large result datasets.

- The app‚Äôs ‚ÄúClutch Delta‚Äù measures how much better or worse a player performs on high-pressure points compared to average.
